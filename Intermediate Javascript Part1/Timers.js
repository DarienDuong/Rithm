1. setTimeout funciton will only run the callback function once while setInterval will run it infinite amount of times
2. setInterval will go on forever with an incremented time specifying how often it should happen
3. the callback function is the first parameter
4. it is important to store it in a variable so we can clear the timer incremented
5. setTimeout and setInterval don't return a value under after the stack is cleared.

not too sure about the answers???
